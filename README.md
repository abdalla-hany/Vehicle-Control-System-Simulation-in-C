# Vehicle Control System Simulation

This C project implements a simulation for a vehicle control system. The system provides functionalities for managing the vehicle's engine, monitoring sensors, and controlling temperatures.

## Features

- Main menu for vehicle control options.
- Engine control (start/stop).
- Sensor monitoring for traffic light and room temperature.
- Temperature control for the engine and room.
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the vehicle control system.

## File Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and the entry point for the program.
- `functions.c`: Implements the core functionalities of the vehicle control system.
- `functions.h`: Contains function prototypes and necessary includes for the project.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the constants defined in `functions.h`. These constants control parameters such as maximum vehicle speed, room temperature range, and engine temperature range.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries
